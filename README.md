This is my first COMPLETED project in Python. I wanted to write a code to perform differentiation on a equation without the use of any math module.
I'd say I managed to do that. But I believe that there is a much easier way to do it. After all, I am just a beginner in programming.
If anyone sees this repo, can you pls read it and inform me about a simple way. 

I uploaded this to GitHub so that I could later on develop it into an application.
